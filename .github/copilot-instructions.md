# Interactive Standard Model Project

This project is an interactive visualization of the Standard Model of particle physics using Three.js for 3D rendering and Python backend for physics calculations.

## Project Structure

- Frontend: Three.js with TypeScript and React for interactive 3D visualizations
- Backend: Python with Flask/FastAPI for physics calculations and particle data
- Features: Interactive particle representations, force visualizations, particle interactions

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety in frontend code
- Follow physics accuracy in particle representations
- Maintain clean separation between visualization and physics logic
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript features
- Follow React best practices for component organization
